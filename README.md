fco-smartpay-skin
=================

Frontend styling of the Barclaycard smartpay system, currently only used by some FCO services.

Documentation for how to edit/update the skin used with FCO Smartpay payments can be found in the [SmartPay_SkinsGuide.pdf] provided by Barclaycard(https://github.com/alphagov/fco-smartpay-skin/blob/master/SmartPay_SkinsGuide.pdf).

The TL;DR version â€”
Brace yourself, this is not very nice to work with. I recommend tea + biscuits before you start and a deep breath...
